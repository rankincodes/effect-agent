# Browser tools

Give an agent rendered page text, extract records, collect a site's Markdown, or let an operator
watch an interactive browser pass. The browser services return bounded, Schema-defined results;
your application supplies Cloudflare bindings or credentials.

Start with a stateless capture for one page. Choose a crawl only when the task needs a bounded set
of same-host pages. Use an interactive pass only when navigation or page actions are essential.

Browser output is untrusted input. Validate model-selected URLs against your host policy and keep
credentials, handles, Live View URLs, and handoff identities out of model Tools and durable records.

In your application, install the browser adapters:

```sh
bun add @effect-agent/platform-cloudflare@beta
```

Requires `effect@^4.0.0-rc.111`. For the examples below, also install `@effect-agent/sandbox@beta`.
Keep framework packages at the [same release](./getting-started#installation-and-compatibility).
The REST examples need no Puppeteer dependency.

## Choose an adapter

### Quick Actions in a Worker

Quick Actions are best for a single render operation: Markdown, selector scrape, screenshot, and
the other Browser Run one-shot actions. A Worker binding authenticates the request without putting
an API token in the Worker. Configure the binding and use a compatibility date of `2026-03-24` or
newer. For local `wrangler dev`, Browser Run Quick Actions need remote mode.

```jsonc
{
  "compatibility_date": "2026-03-24",
  "browser": {
    "binding": "BROWSER",
    "remote": true,
  },
}
```

The `remote` setting is for local development. Deployments use the binding normally. Cloudflare
documents the binding, compatibility date, and remote-mode requirement in its
[Quick Actions guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/).

For a WebCapture Tool, use `CloudflareBrowser.layer(ReadPage, { browser: env.BROWSER })` as shown
below. For direct port access, provide
`BrowserQuickActionBrowserBinding.layer({ browser: env.BROWSER })` to the adapter. Use
`browserQuickActionCaptureLayer` for `PageCapture` and
`browserQuickActionScreenshotLayer` for `PageScreenshot`. The capture adapter supports rendered
Markdown, links, selector scrape, and structured extraction. Structured extraction may invoke
Workers AI: authorize that separately and account for its provider cost before using it.

Quick Actions have no local implementation. Surface rate or quota failures and keep calls bounded.

### REST capture and crawl

The REST adapters run in Node or a Worker and need an account ID, a redacted API token with
**Browser Rendering - Edit** permission, and `FetchHttpClient.layer`. They are useful when the
browser work belongs in a Node service, job, or test harness rather than inside a Worker binding.

`browserRestCaptureLayer` implements `PageCapture`. It can capture rendered Markdown, links,
selector scrape, and extraction requests. `browserRestCrawlLayer` implements
`PageCrawl`: it starts the provider job, polls bounded pages, and cancels a known-running job when
the consuming Scope exits. The REST crawl adapter deliberately exposes only a credential-free HTTPS
starting URL and returns Markdown records from that start host.

Cloudflare's [Markdown endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/markdown-endpoint/)
accepts either a URL or HTML. `PageCaptureRequest` likewise accepts a `PageUrlTarget` or
`PageHtmlTarget`; authorize a URL target in your host before requesting it. Cloudflare's
[`/crawl` documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/crawl-endpoint/)
explains how declared purposes interact with a target site's Content Signals policy. The framework
requires an explicit `purposes` array. Declare `ai-input` when feeding crawled content to a model;
use `search` when building a search index.

### Interactive Browser

An interactive pass owns one browser, context, and page for one Scope. It is for workflows that
need to inspect an active page, follow a known flow, or perform host-approved UI actions. It is not
a general browsing session and cannot become an agent Tool.

Install `@cloudflare/puppeteer@^1.1.0` alongside
`@effect-agent/platform-cloudflare@beta` and `effect-cf@^0.37.0`. Then provide
`CloudflareInteractiveBrowser.layer({ browser: env.BROWSER, accountId, apiToken })` with
`FetchHttpClient.layer` for browser actions. `CloudflareInteractiveBrowser.hostLayer` opts into
trusted host controls for Live View and handoff. Both variants assemble the browser binding and
confirmed-session cleanup; the API token must be redacted. The lower-level binding, lifecycle,
and adapter Layers remain available for custom composition.

The policy is immutable when the pass opens:

- `ExactHosts` permits only a fixed set of HTTPS host authorities for page requests. It is a URL
  allowlist, not a public-network boundary.
- `PublicWeb` requires the adapter to enforce public-address containment at connection time. An
  adapter that cannot enforce it fails before opening a browser. Cloudflare rejects this policy
  with `InteractiveBrowserUnsupportedError` before acquisition.
- `Unrestricted` explicitly opts out of host and private-network containment while retaining the
  action, elapsed-time, and result-byte limits.

Choose `ExactHosts` for a known site. Let a trusted host, never model output, choose
`Unrestricted`. One policy also fixes maximum actions, elapsed time, and bytes returned by each
operation.

## Capture one rendered page from Node

This complete composition captures rendered Markdown through the Node-safe REST adapter. The
application owns the Cloudflare credentials and provides the `HttpClient`; the result stays in the
typed Effect channel.

```ts twoslash
import { browserRestCaptureLayer } from "@effect-agent/platform-cloudflare/browser-rest-capture";
import {
  CapturePageMarkdown,
  PageCapture,
  PageCaptureLimits,
  PageCaptureRequest,
  PageUrlTarget,
} from "@effect-agent/sandbox";
import { Config, Effect } from "effect";
import { FetchHttpClient } from "effect/unstable/http";

const captureExample = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const accountId = yield* Config.nonEmptyString("CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID");
  const apiToken = yield* Config.redacted("CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN");
  return yield* Effect.gen(function* () {
    const capture = yield* PageCapture;
    return yield* capture.capture(
      PageCaptureRequest.make({
        target: PageUrlTarget.make({ url: "https://example.com/" }),
        action: CapturePageMarkdown.make({}),
        engine: "kitesurf",
        limits: PageCaptureLimits.make({ maxOutputBytes: 16 * 1_024 }),
      }),
    );
  }).pipe(Effect.provide(browserRestCaptureLayer({ accountId, apiToken })));
}).pipe(Effect.provide(FetchHttpClient.layer));
```

`PageCaptureRequest` fixes the URL, operation, browser engine, and output limit before the request
starts. It can also carry a fixed resource policy, navigation options, and viewport. Capture
results have a discriminated output type; inspect it before using Markdown, links, scrape groups,
or structured data.

## Give an agent a capture Tool

Install `@effect-agent/capabilities@beta` to wrap capture in a native Effect AI Tool. Fix the allowed
hosts, actions, and output size in the definition. In a Worker, the Cloudflare package assembles
the capture adapter, binding, and handlers in one Layer:

```ts twoslash
import { WebCapture } from "@effect-agent/capabilities";
import {
  CloudflareBrowser,
  type CloudflareBrowserOptions,
} from "@effect-agent/platform-cloudflare/browser-quick-action";
import { Toolkit } from "effect/unstable/ai";

declare const env: { BROWSER: CloudflareBrowserOptions["browser"] };

const ReadPage = WebCapture.make("read_page", {
  description: "Read example.com as rendered Markdown.",
  urls: ["example.com"],
  actions: ["markdown"],
  maxResponseBytes: 16 * 1024,
});

export const BrowserTools = Toolkit.make(ReadPage.tool);
export const ReadPageLive = CloudflareBrowser.layer(ReadPage, {
  browser: env.BROWSER,
});
```

Use `BrowserTools` as the agent's toolkit and provide `ReadPageLive` when running it.
`CloudflareBrowser` is also exported from `@effect-agent/platform-cloudflare`. It accepts
`WebCapture.makeScrape` and `WebCapture.makeExtract` definitions. Extraction requires an explicit
`workersAi` option with an `authorizeAndAccount` Effect, using the same policy as
`BrowserQuickActionWorkersAi.layer`. Without it, extraction fails before making a browser request.
The constructor supplies only `PageCapture`; any schema decoding services remain required.
It preserves the definition's host policy, output bounds, typed failures, and response cleanup.

For REST capture, use the Node-safe REST subpath and supply an HTTP client:

```ts twoslash
import { WebCapture } from "@effect-agent/capabilities";
import {
  CloudflareBrowserRest,
  type CloudflareBrowserRestOptions,
} from "@effect-agent/platform-cloudflare/browser-rest-capture";
import { Layer } from "effect";
import { Toolkit } from "effect/unstable/ai";
import { FetchHttpClient } from "effect/unstable/http";

const readPage = WebCapture.make("read_page", {
  description: "Read example.com as rendered Markdown.",
  urls: ["example.com"],
  actions: ["markdown"],
  maxResponseBytes: 16 * 1024,
});

export const BrowserTools = Toolkit.make(readPage.tool);
export const browserToolsLive = (credentials: CloudflareBrowserRestOptions) =>
  CloudflareBrowserRest.layer(readPage, credentials).pipe(Layer.provide(FetchHttpClient.layer));
```

Use `BrowserTools` as the agent's toolkit and provide `browserToolsLive(credentials)` when running
it. Use `WebCapture.makeScrape` for grouped selector results or `WebCapture.makeExtract` for
Schema-validated extraction. Extraction also needs the adapter's explicit Workers AI authorization
and accounting policy. Capture Tools have uncertain external outcomes because page rendering can
execute JavaScript; they are not eligible for Code Mode's read-only allowlist.

`CloudflareBrowserRest.layer` accepts the same optional `workersAi` policy as the Worker
constructor. It preserves schema decoding requirements and leaves `HttpClient` injectable.
For a custom capture adapter, provide its Layer directly to `readPage.handlers`.

## Capture and crawl {#capture-and-crawl}

### Crawl bounded same-host Markdown

`PageCrawl.crawl` returns a Stream. Consume it within `Effect.scoped` so interrupting the enclosing work
cancels the provider job when the adapter has a job identity to clean up.

```ts twoslash
import { browserRestCrawlLayer } from "@effect-agent/platform-cloudflare/browser-rest-crawl";
import { PageCrawl, PageCrawlLimits, PageCrawlRequest } from "@effect-agent/sandbox";
import { Config, Effect, Layer, Stream } from "effect";
import { FetchHttpClient } from "effect/unstable/http";

const BrowserCrawlLive = Layer.unwrap(
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const accountId = yield* Config.nonEmptyString("CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID");
    const apiToken = yield* Config.redacted("CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN");
    return browserRestCrawlLayer({ accountId, apiToken });
  }),
).pipe(Layer.provide(FetchHttpClient.layer));

const crawlDocumentation = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const crawl = yield* PageCrawl;

  return yield* crawl
    .crawl(
      PageCrawlRequest.make({
        startUrl: "https://example.com/docs/",
        purposes: ["search"],
        limits: PageCrawlLimits.make({
          maxPages: 10,
          maxDepth: 2,
          maxPageBytes: 64 * 1_024,
          maxTotalBytes: 512 * 1_024,
          deadlineMillis: 120_000,
        }),
      }),
    )
    .pipe(Stream.runCollect);
}).pipe(Effect.scoped, Effect.provide(BrowserCrawlLive));
```

The Layer loads the real account ID and redacted token once from application configuration. The
operation keeps the crawl and its cleanup in one Scope.

Each record includes a URL, provider status, optional bounded Markdown, and optional origin
metadata. A non-completed status may have no Markdown. Treat a rate limit, protocol failure,
caller limit, or provider terminal status as a typed crawl failure. Do not turn it into an empty
successful crawl.

The framework caps requests at 100 pages, depth 10, 8 MiB per page, 64 MiB total, and a 10-minute
deadline. Keep limits lower for an agent request and declare the narrowest
`purposes` array. The provider's crawl job identity and pagination are private to the adapter.

## Capture a PNG

`PageScreenshot` is the stateless counterpart to an interactive screenshot. It returns exactly one
bounded `image/png` byte array, which the caller owns. Use the Quick Action screenshot layer in a
Worker; the REST capture adapter implements `PageCapture`, not `PageScreenshot`. Set the full-page
choice and byte limit in `PageScreenshotRequest`; do not persist image bytes in framework
thread records by default.

For a single known URL, use a stateless screenshot instead of opening an interactive session.
Choose an interactive screenshot only when it must reflect the page after navigation, filling,
clicking, or scrolling in that same pass.

## Interact with a browser {#interact-with-a-browser}

Open the browser inside `Effect.scoped`, then use the handle only inside that Scope. The handle
supports navigation, text reads, fill, click, screenshot, scroll, and early explicit close. Click
and fill require exactly one matching element. Action failures are typed; malformed selectors and
an undispatched provider action can be identified without treating them as a successful no-op.

```ts twoslash
// @types: @cloudflare/workers-types
import { CloudflareInteractiveBrowser } from "@effect-agent/platform-cloudflare/interactive-browser";
import {
  BrowserNavigateRequest,
  BrowserReadTextRequest,
  InteractiveBrowser,
  InteractiveBrowserPolicy,
} from "@effect-agent/sandbox";
import { Effect, Layer, Redacted } from "effect";
import { FetchHttpClient } from "effect/unstable/http";
import { WorkerEnvironment } from "effect-cf";

// In an application, Wrangler generates these binding types.
declare global {
  namespace Cloudflare {
    interface Env {
      readonly BROWSER: BrowserRun;
      readonly CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID: string;
      readonly BROWSER_RENDERING_API_TOKEN: string;
    }
  }
}

const InteractiveLive = Layer.unwrap(
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const env = yield* WorkerEnvironment;
    return CloudflareInteractiveBrowser.layer({
      browser: env.BROWSER,
      accountId: env.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID,
      apiToken: Redacted.make(env.BROWSER_RENDERING_API_TOKEN),
    }).pipe(Layer.provide(FetchHttpClient.layer));
  }),
);

export const readExampleDomain = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const browser = yield* InteractiveBrowser;
  const handle = yield* browser.open(
    InteractiveBrowserPolicy.make({
      network: { _tag: "ExactHosts", allowedHosts: ["example.com"] },
      maxActions: 3,
      maxElapsedMillis: 30_000,
      maxReturnedBytes: 16 * 1_024,
    }),
  );
  yield* handle.navigate(BrowserNavigateRequest.make({ url: "https://example.com/" }));
  return yield* handle.readText(BrowserReadTextRequest.make({}));
}).pipe(Effect.scoped);

export const program = readExampleDomain.pipe(Effect.provide(InteractiveLive));
```

`readExampleDomain` requires only `InteractiveBrowser`. `InteractiveLive` yields `WorkerEnvironment`
to construct the Cloudflare adapter, so the composed `program` retains `WorkerEnvironment` in `R`.
Run it inside an `effect-cf` Worker, which supplies that service. Tests can provide a different
`InteractiveBrowser` Layer to the same operation.

The adapter installs `BrowserRunSessionLifecycle` even for ordinary actions because every session
needs exact-session cleanup. The browser closes on Scope exit even after an interruption. Running
`handle.close` ends the pass early and invalidates that handle.

## Host Live View and handoff

`BrowserRunInteractiveHost` extends the regular pass with a short-lived redacted Live View URL,
handoff start, handoff state, and host-controlled close. Keep these operations in trusted Worker
code. Your application can expose these controls through an authenticated operator UI. Never
expose them to the model or store them in canonical threads.

The host layer requires `BrowserRunSessionLifecycle.layer({ accountId, apiToken })` and
`FetchHttpClient.layer` in addition to the browser binding. The lifecycle token permits exact-session
cleanup for every interactive pass; browser actions themselves use the Worker binding. Give a Live
View a short expiry and a handoff a finite timeout. Your application owns authentication, operator
authorization, and what happens after a handoff.

An interactive session is ephemeral. The framework neither stores a session nor reconnects it after
a restart, eviction, ownership loss, or durable recovery. A live browser action is uncertain at
that boundary, so do not automatically replay it.

## Protected login and card filling

`ProtectedBrowser` is a separate private pass, not an upgrade of an interactive session. Import
`browserRunProtectedLayer` and `browserRunProtectedBindingLayer` from
`@effect-agent/platform-cloudflare/protected-browser`. Provide the binding Layer, the same
`BrowserRunSessionLifecycle` used above, and an invocation-specific `BrowserCredentialAccess`.
Use `ExactHosts` for a fixed network allowlist. `Unrestricted` is an explicit host choice;
`PublicWeb` is unsupported. Credential grants never expand network policy.

The host access service owns caller authentication, vault lookup, current grants, and recipient
trust. Derive caller identity from the authorized invocation, never model arguments or possession
of an offer. `list` authorizes only bounded display metadata, such as a label, brand, and last four
digits, not vault keys or credentials. `authorize` checks current ownership, purpose, field roles,
submission permission, and exact canonical HTTPS top-level, frame, and form-recipient origins,
including non-default ports. Card grants must match both merchant and processor/frame. `resolve`
returns Schema-validated `Redacted` material after those checks; authorization repeats before each
field write and submission. Host services must never put material in logs, defects, or traces.

The runtime protocol needs no site-specific selectors:

1. `navigate` to a host-authorized HTTPS URL, then `observe` bounded text and native controls.
2. Select discovered field references and request `listCredentialOffers({ kind, target })`.
3. Propose `useCredential({ offer, fields, submit? })` with only opaque refs and field roles.
4. Continue with `observe`, `navigate`, or `click` under the post-exposure observation grant.

References bind actual nodes, documents, frames, forms, and roles. Node replacement, changed
form/action/role, frame navigation, rediscovery, or 60 seconds of elapsed time invalidates them.
Offers expire after 60 seconds, are single-use, and bind caller, kind, and target. A private lock
spans checks, resolution, mutation, and post-use checks; competing operations return `busy`.
The adapter uses an isolated browser world and native setters, not model-provided JavaScript.

Supported controls are native username/email/password inputs, native login form submission, and
standard `cc-*` card fields, including native selects. HTTPS frames may be same- or cross-origin
when every involved origin is allowed. Opaque frames, popups, shadow/custom controls, CAPTCHA,
OTP, passkeys, wallets, and 3DS have no automation fallback. Invalid native form requirements
produce `needs-attention`. Card filling never submits a purchase. Filling can itself execute page
handlers and cause side effects, which the host must authorize.

### Protection and recipient trust

Secrets enter only the private browser transport, not Tool arguments/results, normal errors,
traces, checkpoints, or journals. The handle exposes no raw fill, JavaScript, screenshot, Live
View, DevTools, handoff, or provider identity. A fresh session is acquired with `recording=false`
explicitly on the wire. This relies on Cloudflare's opt-in recording behavior; no independent
recording-enabled attestation endpoint exists.

Cloudflare account administrators and Browser Rendering token holders are trusted operators.
They must not attach viewers, DevTools, recordings, or other observers to private sessions.
Protection does not extend to those operators or a compromised provider. Expiring a viewer URL
does not make a previously exposed session private; always open a fresh pass.

After any possibly dispatched secret write, every observation and non-secret action requires
`observation` to return `trust-recipient-no-credential-echo` for current origins and prior exposures.
This explicitly trusts the recipient not to echo raw, encoded, transformed, or delayed credentials.
It is not universal secrecy against hostile pages. Discovery omits input values, but DOM scrubbing
and substring redaction cannot make arbitrary pages safe. Denial blocks observation before reading
page text. The same private context retains authenticated state; no cookie export or general-browser
handoff occurs. Request interception does not contain every worker, socket, or page network path.
Only use recipients the host is willing to trust with the material.

### Lifetime, evidence, and recovery

Build `ProtectedBrowserSession.layer(policy)` once around an execution and provide it to native
Effect AI Toolkit handlers. Its lazy `get` shares one handle across successive Tool calls. Do not
scope each Tool separately or put caller/vault/session state in a process or Durable Object singleton.
The [compiled consumer example](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/blob/main/examples/browser-run-worker-proof/src/protected-browser.ts)
shows handlers and dummy grants.

For durable execution, put the handlers and session Layer in `AgentRegistration.attemptLayer`.
Its factory receives trusted `threadId`, `submissionId`, and `attemptId`; use these to resolve the
authorized invocation. The Layer spans all Tool/model turns of one fenced Attempt and finalizes on
completion, suspension, failure, or interruption. A replacement Attempt builds fresh services.
Keep fallible browser acquisition in `session.get`, not Layer construction. No additional browser
Durable Object or persisted browser-session record is needed.

Credential Tools are ordinary effectful Tools. Do not mark them readonly/idempotent or expose them
through the read-only Code Mode bridge. The existing prepared/settled journal governs recovery:
an unresolved mutation is never automatically replayed after ownership loss. Old refs fail in a
replacement Attempt; the application/operator must reconcile an uncertain external outcome.

`CredentialUseResult` and `ProtectedBrowserError` report independent `dispatch`, `milestone`,
`observation`, and `cleanup` fields. `filled` proves acknowledged writes, not authentication;
`submission-dispatched` proves dispatch, not login success. `authentication` is always `unverified`.
Check an approved authenticated page separately. `possibly-dispatched` can coexist with
`partial-fill` and confirmed cleanup: closure does not undo effects. Provider defects are sanitized;
failures after dispatch and cancellation invalidate and close the pass. Close waits for exact-session
termination/absence and reports `unconfirmed` when it cannot prove cleanup. Logs contain only a
fixed cleanup warning, never provider diagnostics or secret-bearing page data.

## Limits, cleanup, and network boundaries

Browser APIs use finite requests and typed expected failures:

- `PageCapture` fixes one output-byte limit. Navigation, rate, protocol, unsupported-operation, and
  output-limit failures remain typed.
- `PageCrawl` fixes the start host, purposes, page/depth/byte/deadline limits, and cancellation
  lifecycle. Its stream ends only after the provider reports a terminal result or a typed failure.
- `PageScreenshot` accepts only PNG and enforces a caller-selected byte limit.
- An interactive policy fixes network mode, at most 1,000 actions, at most 10 minutes, and at most
  8 MiB from one result. Handles expire at policy limits or explicit close.

These caps do not authorize the destination, protect every network path, or make provider actions
replay-safe. Keep an application allowlist for stateless capture; choose the interactive network
policy that matches the actual isolation guarantee; and treat all rendered data as untrusted.

`isBrowserRunUndispatchedActionError` identifies selector failures before dispatch. Callers can
correct those selectors. Other action failures invalidate the handle; never retry a mutation
whose outcome is unknown. Interruption cannot reliably cancel an action already sent to Puppeteer.

`readText().text` contains JSON with page text, selector counts, and at most 64 controls.
Control diagnostics omit field values and HTML. Results, including PNG screenshots, obey the
pass byte limit. Logs omit URLs, selectors, labels, field values, credentials, and provider errors.

Set the initial `viewport` on `BrowserRunInteractiveBinding.layer` or use the host session's
`resizeViewport`. Width and height accept integers in `1..2048`; `deviceScaleFactor` accepts
`1..2`, defaults to `1`, and must satisfy `max(width, height) * deviceScaleFactor <= 2048`.
Mobile, touch, and orientation options are unsupported. Resizing consumes no agent action but
remains subject to the pass deadline and lock. Authorize viewport changes in your host.

Session closure waits up to ten seconds to confirm whole-browser termination or exact-session
absence. A pending close or transport/authentication failure is not proof of cleanup.
`BrowserRunCleanupError` reports a sanitized reason. Correct authorization or configuration
failures before retrying. The [interactive browser API comments](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/blob/main/packages/platform-cloudflare/src/interactive-browser.ts)
describe action timing and lifecycle details.

## Hosted binding proof

The repository includes an [opt-in temporary deployment proof](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/tree/main/examples/browser-run-worker-proof).
It exercises the hosted Browser Run binding with Markdown capture, selector scrape, PNG screenshot,
an interactive pass, a short Live View, and a short handoff. After closing that session it opens a
fresh protected pass, exercises two dummy login layouts and a card frame, checks revocation and
authenticated continuation, confirms cleanup, then deletes the temporary Worker.
It needs Cloudflare credentials and is not a turnkey application or a durable browser-session
solution. Its README documents the environment variables and the explicit command.

## Next steps

- [Tools & layers](./tools) explains how browser services become bounded Effect AI Tools.
- [Cloudflare](../platforms/cloudflare) covers Durable Object agent hosts.
- [Operations](./operations#authorization-and-isolation) covers host authorization and isolation.
