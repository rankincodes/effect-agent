Preserve tool definitions when selecting a required completion tool.

- [#244](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/244) [`e1e29a0`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/e1e29a015d1695fcabd09cc61793d206e96702ae) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Reserve a final review response when token, turn, or tool budgets stop investigation, preserving findings and usage.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Treat outcomes with `exhausted` as incomplete coverage, even when no findings are returned.

- [#250](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/250) [`d004a36`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/d004a361518c23cdc81f1768e5ab31560e014935) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Retain recorded review findings when research stops, mark partial results with `incomplete` or `exhausted`, and admit review Action requests only below $1. Permit completion on the single grace turn and reuse stable OpenAI prompt prefixes.

  to the private channel. Review large diffs in one bounded four-shard parallel wave, limit automatic
  GitHub waves to two, require a collaborator command for later reviews, and present findings with
  severity and category labels plus agent-ready prompts.

  snapshots across bounded PR paths, then hydrating changed paths from the current full PR records.
  Fall back to a full review with an observable reason when either snapshot is unavailable, malformed,
  or truncated.

- [#156](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/156) [`c210275`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/c2102759a41ea392fc6493d11696debc22f9cf80) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Let Action and CLI users opt each OpenAI review into Fast processing with `service-tier: fast`, and reject the provider-specific setting when Anthropic is selected.

Reopen discovery only for paths whose candidate verification must be regenerated.

Inject prior-round findings on re-reviewed paths into incremental reviewer prompts; **BEHAVIOR CHANGE:** direct `PrReview.run` callers now provide `ReviewExecutionContext`, using `fullReviewExecutionContextLayer` for an explicit full review.

- [#140](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/140) [`eb9c5fd`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/eb9c5fd4683a63807b131f8c8d94e9c1205bd36d) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Remove deprecated pull-request review outputs and aliases, legacy review-state decoding, and unused
  Travel Planner fixtures. Require Cloudflare worker bindings to use the per-incarnation callback.

### Patch Changes

- [#145](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/145) [`84aef35`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/84aef359e7551330204557c940d8c2c5db773bec) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Report undiffable files (binaries, oversized files) in gate reasons, the posted
  review callout, and the step summary with the honest remedy — remove them from
  the pull request or exclude them with ignore globs — instead of promising an
  automatic retry that can never settle them.

- [#143](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/143) [`a0ce59c`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/a0ce59c8b172cb1a5cbfdd57086401fb1714157d) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Bind review-body concerns to their changed evidence paths so incremental reviews recheck them when related files change or disappear. Distinguish current findings from carried concerns in posted review counts.

  A rewritten head no longer fail-closes to a full-diff rediscovery when a two-dot tree comparison can name the current PR paths whose contents changed. Outdated GitHub comments that omit `line` no longer block stale-review retirement.

- [#136](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/136) [`966fe3a`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/966fe3ab5f01d4f812f97b6cda7a6ac7f3a46f68) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Hash review fingerprints through Effect `Crypto.Crypto` instead of `globalThis.crypto`.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: `computeChangesetFingerprint`, `computeProfileFingerprint`, and `PrReview` fingerprint/`run` Effects now require `Crypto.Crypto`. Node CLI/Action hosts already satisfy this via `NodeServices.layer`.

  run, carrying unsettled or unreviewable scope forward for automatic retry, and fan-out passes
  are host-scheduled with one retry each so a flaky pass can no longer reopen the whole
  post-baseline scope. BEHAVIOR CHANGE: stored review state moved to `state-v2` (the first run
  after upgrading performs one full review), blocking findings now outrank machinery gaps in the
  check conclusion, and the coordinator-model exports (`FanOutReviewer`, `makeFanOutReviewSuite`,
  `fanOutHandlersLayer`, `DelegateFileReview`, `FileReviewRequest`, `FileReviewUnitResult`,
  `FileReviewWorkRejected`, `FileReviewUnitFailed`, `ListReviewUnits`) and the
  `usageScope`/`reviewShape` options are removed — fan-out runs report whole-run usage via
  `executeFanOutReview`.

### Patch Changes

- [#125](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/125) [`1581182`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/1581182cc7b06dcc340d15f32c8af93ecc4f0902) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Remove the ignored `failOn` option from `runReviewAction` and the `FailOnPolicy` export; host-derived check conclusions were already unconditional, so the option had no effect. The packaged Action still accepts the deprecated `fail-on` input and continues to ignore it.

A confirmed finding whose suggestion is not settled as committable is published without the suggestion block, and a verification pass that leaves a carried suggestion unsettled fails the unit's settlement.

  specialist discovery, and request-bound verification that publishes only confirmed candidates.
  Default the Action to this fan-out pipeline and require complete input assignment plus settled
  configured work before emitting authenticated incremental state or a successful conclusion.

- Updated dependencies [[`c715f9f`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/c715f9f8e436fa85e8c1ef2b27f640e637ea52e4), [`c715f9f`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/c715f9f8e436fa85e8c1ef2b27f640e637ea52e4)]:

  comment now ends with a collapsed "🤖 Prompt for AI agents" copy-paste block
  (opening with a fixed untrusted-review-data preamble), and the review body adds
  a consolidated all-findings prompt so demoted and carried findings hand an
  agent their instruction too. The body opens with a host-derived stats line —
  changeset size, severity tally, and a deterministic 1–5 review-effort estimate
  — and renders the model's new optional per-file `walkthrough` as a collapsed
  table whose paths are validated against the changeset like finding anchors
  (fan-out children report `fileSummaries`, projected and merged by the
  coordinator, and host-verified against the delegation Tool events so only
  in-unit child-reported summaries survive; carried findings' prompts cite their
  baseline commit, never the current head). Findings may carry an optional
  `category` chip rendered beside
  the severity; demoted and carried-finding sections collapse into counted
  `<details>` blocks. Oversized bodies shed the consolidated prompt first, then
  the walkthrough, before any review item, and every omission stays announced.
  Stale-review retirement matches both the categorized and the pre-category
  inline first-line formats.

- [#87](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/87) [`68addaa`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/68addaa026927a75d193b64cdb86542e5c37345b) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Make review runs visible while they execute. The packaged Action now posts one sticky "review in
  progress" issue comment the moment a run starts — naming the scope, head commit, model, and
  workflow run — and rewrites that same comment in place with the settled outcome (posted verdict,
  blocking/incomplete callout, or run failure). Posting is at-least-once with generation-fenced
  writes: a stale run cannot replace a newer run's status, and duplicate comments left by unfenced
  overlapping runs are best-effort deleted by the next run. Progress reporting is cosmetic and
  fail-open: GitHub faults are logged and never change the review, the check conclusion, or the run
  result. Disable with the new `progress-comment` input; dry runs post no progress.

  Action logs now render one compact line per event (tool executions, warnings with their cause)
  instead of raw OTel-style telemetry dumps. The new `log-level` input (default `Info`) shows the
  engine's per-turn telemetry at `Debug` or quiets routine runs at `Warn`.

### Patch Changes

- [#87](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/87) [`68addaa`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/68addaa026927a75d193b64cdb86542e5c37345b) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Keep exploratory out-of-scope reads from killing a review run. The read tools already return
  typed refusals as model-visible results, but the engine's default 3-consecutive-failure stop
  policy aborted the run when one parallel batch probed several paths outside the review scope —
  the first incremental delta whose pull-request description named other files died this way before
  the model had seen a single refusal. The flat reviewer and per-unit child policies now tolerate an
  exploratory batch (`repeatedFailureLimit: 12`, still bounded by their tool-call and duration
  budgets), and the reviewer instructions state explicitly that the listed changeset is the complete
  readable scope — in incremental reviews a deliberate subset of the pull request's full diff.

## 0.1.0-beta.9

### Minor Changes

- [#75](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/75) [`dcea6cb`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/dcea6cb50ff2835bd72446202742029c35c321bb) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Retire prior marker-bearing bot reviews after a newer review posts: supersede and collapse their bodies, strike findings resolved by the newest authenticated state, minimize matching inline comments as outdated, and keep cosmetic retirement failures fail-open.

## 0.1.0-beta.8

### Patch Changes

- [#68](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/68) [`fd16e63`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/fd16e63f34df0653afdf7ef167bc1ddd324676b6) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Activate native context compaction for the packaged flat, file-unit, and fan-out coordinator
  reviewers with a 150k-token live-context ceiling. This keeps output and summary headroom while
  preserving the existing cumulative token budgets; tool-heavy review histories prune old results
  before paying for a summarization call.

## 0.1.0-beta.7

### Minor Changes

- [#54](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/54) [`afe755a`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/afe755a331172ffca9ceee7dd82bb452c6ccbb8a) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Context economics ([#54](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/issues/54), RUN-022–027/CAP-017): application tool results are bounded by default (50 KiB
  `TruncatedToolResult` envelopes), budget accounting becomes cache-aware with last-call
  live-context tracking, every request can carry a derived run-status message, the token
  dimension joins the `onExhaustion` soft landing (RUN-018) with the `exhausted` dimension marker,
  and the engine compacts natively at the pre-Turn seam (prune, then one metered summarize)
  with a canonical `CompactionCreated` record that projections fold across Runs; provider
  context-length rejections compact-and-retry once, then fail typed (`ContextOverflowError`).

- [#50](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/50) [`b44ed77`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/b44ed7771c3e1ace2516507b0b54d11e662f036c) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Delegation containment (D-037, ADR-0019 S2, SUB-033): `Subagent.define` gains
  `failureMode: "error" | "return"` (default `"error"`, today's semantics). Under `"return"` every
  expected delegation failure — the declared child failure plus `SubagentPrestartDenied`,
  `SubagentBudgetExhausted`, `SubagentProjectionFailure`, and `SubagentExecutionFailure` — becomes
  model-visible result data in the Tool success union instead of failing the parent Run, so one
  dead child cannot detonate a fan-out. The engine signals (`ToolCallWaiting`,
  `SubagentDurabilityError`) always stay in the error channel, preserving durable suspension by
  construction, and the durable settlement join records the contained failure with the same
  non-failure polarity the live batch continues with. pr-review retires its same-name shadow-Tool
  workaround for the first-party option, adopts the S1 `final-answer` soft landing in all three
  default reviewer policies (an exhausted child or coordinator now returns a partial review instead
  of "unit unreviewed: AgentPolicyError"), and reverts the fan-out `repeatedFailureLimit` sizing
  hack. Contained unit failures reach coverage classification with richer tags
  (`FileReviewUnitFailed:<childErrorTag>`).

## 0.1.0-beta.6

### Patch Changes

- [#39](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/39) [`e13ee6e`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/e13ee6e7817549e99837d06e86caf2dea8656aa8) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Budget soft landing (D-037, ADR-0019, RUN-018/019/020): `AgentPolicy` gains
  `onExhaustion: "final-answer" | "fail"`, defaulting to `"final-answer"` — Turn and Tool Call
  exhaustion now settle the Run through one constrained final-answer opportunity instead of failing
  it. An over-budget Tool batch settles synthetically as model-visible failed results (no handler
  starts, no durable batch declaration, exempt from repeated-failure folding), subsequent model
  requests carry `toolChoice: "none"`, Turn exhaustion admits exactly one grace Turn, and the Run
  completes with the honest `finishReason: "budget-exhausted"` on the live event, the reduced
  `AgentResult`, and (additively) the durable `SubmissionSettled` record. Duration, token, cost, and
  repeated-failure bounds stay hard rails; `onExhaustion: "fail"` preserves the prior run-fatal
  behavior exactly. BEHAVIOR CHANGE ON UPGRADE: Turn/Tool-Call budget deaths become honest
  completions unless a policy pins `"fail"` — `@effect-agent/pr-review` pins `"fail"` pending its
  containment rework.

- [#26](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/26) [`9d9bc91`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/9d9bc910de6b0acf751d6729e955e1554688dd89) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Add a `guidance-file` action input (`PR_REVIEW_GUIDANCE_FILE`): the review
  guidance can now live as a committed review-profile document instead of
  workflow YAML, read at run time and injected before any inline `guidance`.
  A configured-but-unreadable file fails typed rather than reviewing without
  its profile.

- [#43](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/43) [`0778186`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/077818687de70f209c1e1269fae45b9c205b7b05) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Make GitHub Action PR reviews incremental across corrective pushes using authenticated,
  lineage-validated review state, preserve unresolved findings and accepted scope, provide an
  explicit final full-diff audit, and fail the review check for blocking findings or incomplete
  coverage. Align delegated file-review tool-call bounds with the maximum review-unit size so
  normal diff and context reads can complete without deterministic policy exhaustion.

- [#21](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/21) [`93281be`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/93281be964d11caa63b5efed2976835780ca1eb8) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Introduce `@effect-agent/pr-review`: the pull-request reviewer promoted from
  `examples/pr-review` into a publishable package (owner decision D-034,
  ADR-0016). Schema-first review contracts, `PullRequestSource`/`ReviewPublisher`
  ports with GitHub REST adapters, fail-closed anchor validation and publication
  planning, flat and S1 fan-out reviewer shapes, the `PrReview` configuration
  factory (guidance, policy override, findings bound, ignore globs, extra
  read-only tools), a deterministic `./testing` entry, and `./action`/`./cli`
  host entrypoints backing the prebuilt node-runtime GitHub Action at `action/`.
  Deployment class E; review posting is never claimed exactly-once.

- [#23](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/23) [`b5b31b8`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/b5b31b8b9c9870e0e6efd30ff305adde4021ba4f) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Skip re-reviews of unchanged changesets. Every posted review now embeds an
  invisible changeset fingerprint (SHA-256 over the ignore-filtered changeset
  plus the prompt signature); the action harness and the CLI's
  `--skip-unchanged` compare it against the last posted review through the new
  `PriorReviews` port and skip typed when nothing effective changed — so
  base-branch auto-merges and equivalent rebases stop re-triggering reviews,
  while real changes, conflict resolutions, and configuration changes still
  review. Fails open: a fingerprint lookup fault reviews instead of skipping.
  `PrReview.make`/`makeFanOut` expose the fingerprint; `runReviewAction` now
  takes the reviewer object (`{ run, fingerprint }`) and a `skip-unchanged`
  action input (default `true`).
